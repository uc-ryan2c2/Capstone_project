# Capstone_project
This is the repo that will hold the code for Senior Design

The goal of this project is to make an anti cheat systetm that will allow teachers to upload and scan a test to see if there are any answers online.
The script will mark where the asnwers where found so teachers can double-check what the script found.
At the end, the test will get a score with how easy it is to "cheat" on.
